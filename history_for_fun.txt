Katherine President 

If I have to summarise my life in 3 words, it will be my Family, Food and Friends. They are the 3 Fs without which my liFe would be a lie. Same goes to the community of graduate students in SUTD, I hope that our friendship can grow to that of a family through food for the stomach, brain and soul.

I will keep the faith that people who are optimistic to think that they can bring joy to others are the ones who do it.
